# **Public Library System**

Project for Principles of Database Systems

## Brief Description

RTL (Read Think and Learn) is a public library. It serves the community by providing access to diversified resources, affordable rental services, free room reservations and various educational events. RTL intends to convert its file system based data management to sophisticated centralized database system. There are two main objectives of our project: design the relational database, and create a web-based user interface.

## Project Structure

1. Design a relational model based on the business rules using *Oracle DataModeler*.
2. Generate DDL Code and add some trigger code due to realistic usage.
3. Deploy the database on local server using *XMAPP*.
4. Create front-end user interface using PHP and HTML.

For more information, please view the reports [Part1](Report_Part1.pdf) and [Part2](Report_Part2.pdf).

## Usage

Double click ```other/login.php``` to start the server.
